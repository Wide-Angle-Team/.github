## Introduction to Wide-Angle-Team (WAT)

# What is WAT?

This is a github organization that contains theory and estimator code that are used for SPHEREx, but also are often used for other research projects, such as exploratory projects that are not 
officially part of the SPHEREx pipeline yet, as well as student projects. It is outside of the SPHEREx Github organization, which has stricter access control. 

# Repo organizations 

[A description of various repos go here]

The code is written in julia, available here: https://github.com/Wide-Angle-Team/LogNormalSimulations
The README should be fairly self-explanatory, but may very well be incomplete.
We can then go into more details on how to configure and run the code. It mainly makes use of two packages: LogNormalGalaxies.jl and MeasurePowerSpectra.jl. They are both in the Wide-Angle-Team organization on github. With any luck, you will not need to interact directly with them, only with LogNormalSimulations.
